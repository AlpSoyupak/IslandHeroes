The project is currently able to generate a random map with **X** number of tiles at every launch.

One moveable character is spawned every time the game is triggered to launch. The character can be selected by clicking on it then moved
around the map by clicking on any map location.

(The value of **X** is defined as an input parameter on the **MapGenerator** object Inspector view on Unity)

It is only needed to checkout the repository using git, load the project using Unity, then press play.
